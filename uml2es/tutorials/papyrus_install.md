# How To Install Papyrus UML

First, install a recent version of Eclipse. I installed Neon. 

Next, install Papyrus. In Eclipse, go to the Help menu and select Install New Software. Under "Work With", select your version of Eclipse; I chose "Neon - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon".  Then in the text bar where it says "type filter text" type "Papyrus UML". Select "Papyrus UML" from the list.

Eclipse will spend the next few minutes installing Papyrus. You will see a progress bar that looks like this. Leave it alone. Let it finish.
