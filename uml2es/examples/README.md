Summary of examples:

- examples/movies: A sample UML model for movies. Includes ml-gradle build file to load this model into MarkLogic. Shows the full UML-to-ES workflow including ingestion of ES envelopes, deploying ES-generated database indexes, and running SQL against TDE views. The movie model demonstrates several types of document relationships. 
- examples/hr: A sample UML model for human resources. It models Departments and Employees. The sample shows how to load HR data into a MarkLogic data hub. It also demonstrates semantic relationships though the use of an organizational ontology.
- examples/runningRace: A sample demonstrating interop. We model a running race in two UML editors: MagicDraw and Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). We show that both UML models transform to the same ES model descriptor. Our model is based on one of the examples from MarkLogic's Entity Services github: <https://github.com/marklogic/entity-services/tree/master/entity-services-examples/example-races/>. 
- examples/blockFactory: A sample UML model that shows a technique for denormalization.
- examples/umlModels: Additional sample UML models
