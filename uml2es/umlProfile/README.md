This folder contains the UML profile for MarkLogic Entity Services. When defining your UML model in your UML tool of choice, import this profile into the tool to allow you to stereotype your model with ES-specific stereotypes.

How to do this depends on which tool you choose. In MagicDraw, for example, with your model open, from File menu select Use Project.
