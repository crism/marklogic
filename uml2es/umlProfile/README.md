This part of the toolkit has two MarkLogic profiles for UML:

- [magicdraw/MLProfile.xml](magicdraw/MLProfile.xml): A MagicDraw project for designing the profile.
- [MLProfile.xml](MLProfile.xml): An standard XMI profile meant for any UML tool that is compliant with the toolkit. This profile is not directly constructed but is derived from the MagicDraw profile.

UNLESS YOU ARE DEVELOPING THE TOOLKIT, YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO EDIT THE PROFILE.
