# UML Profile for MarkLogic Entity Services

## Intro
This folder contains the UML profile for MarkLogic Entity Services. When defining your UML model in your UML tool of choice, import this profile into the tool to allow you to stereotype your model with ES-specific stereotypes.

How to do this depends on which tool you choose. In MagicDraw, for example, with your model open, from File menu select Use Project. 

Here is a visual representation of the profile:

## Reference
Here is a reference..

TODO - reference
- in discussing FK : we intrepret ES local reference (#ref) as a way to tell instance coverter codegen to use containment rather than reference; our "FK" stereotype means reference; there is no TDE implication to this; TDE cares about PK, as this affects semantic triples generated by TDE
